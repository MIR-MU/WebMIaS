                WebMIaS is a web interface for Math Indexer and Searcher (MIaS) math aware searching engine.
                It provides the ability to search scientific documents for mathematical formulae, in addition
                to standard textual words. It is based on
                fulltext search engine <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>. MIaS uses several
                unification algorithms to be able to search for equal formulae with a certain degree of different
                notation. It also allows one to search for subformulae.
                MIaS is able to search for mathematical and textual content at the same time. By specifying one
                or more text terms in mathematical query, the results can be effectively narrowed down. Of course,
                you can search only for text.
            </p>
            <h3 id="help">Help on querying</h3>
            <p align="justify">
                There are two languages for inputting math supported &emdash; TeX and presentation MathML.
                MathML notated queries must be written with no tag prefix. 
                TeX mathematical queries must be enclosed in $ signs.
                You can search for several formulae at the same time, just place one expression after another.
                Mathematical queries are additionally canonicalized using our canonicalizer 
                library to avoid any inconsistencies in the query.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                MIaS allows you to search for textual content as well. If you would like to search 
                for mathematics and text at the same
                time, place the text queries into the appropriate facets, either title or content.
            </p>
            <p>Number of results is currently limited to 10,000.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>

                You can find examples on the <a href="examples.xhtml">example</a> page.
